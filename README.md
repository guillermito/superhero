## Write your HTML in index.html, your CSS in styles.css, and your JS in script.js

HTML:
  Give your page a title. Be creative!
  Create a div with the ID "searchbox"
  Add an input field and a button to your "searchbox" div
  Create another div with ID "results"
  Add the following to your results div:
    an h3 tag with the class "codename"
    an h5 tag with the class "realname"
    a p tag with the class "power"
    a p tag with the class "enemy"
    *Remember to close your tags!
  
  JS:
  Create a "hero" object that contains at least 4 heroes 
  with the following properties:
    codename, identity, power, enemy
  Create a "for" loop for the "hero" object
  Inside your "for" loop, add an "if" statement; the condition 
  should check if the value of the input field is equal to the 
  hero's codename
  If your condition is true, use .text to:
    add the codename to the "codename" tag
    add the identity to the "realname" tag
    add the power to the "power" tag
    add the enemy to the "enemy" tag
  
  Check to see if your code works!
  
  CSS:
  Change the font of the "body" tag to: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
  Add margin: 0 auto to all "div" tags
  Add a background color to your "searchbox" div
  Add a different background color to your "results" div
  Change the font-size so that the "enemy" is smaller than "power"
  Give your "button" the following styles:
    padding, background-color, color
  Add padding to the "searchbox" and "results" divs
  
  Add any other styles you want!
